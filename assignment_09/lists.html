		<h1>Top 10 Places I've Traveled</h1>
		<ol>

			<li>Scotland
				<p>
					From June to September of 2013, Brian and I lived in Glasgow, Scotland.
					We were there because Brian got a grant from the Whitaker Foundation
					so that he could do research at Strathclyde University. While we were
					there we traveled all around Scotland and to other countries.
				</p>
				<p>Highlights from Scotland:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Glasgow's West End</li>
					<li>Edinburgh Castle</li>
					<li>Glencoe</li>
					<li>Eilean Donan Castle</li>
					<li>St. Andrew's Old Course</li>
				</ul>

				<p class= "italic">
					Tip: If you plan on seeing more than one castle, join the Scotland
					Historical Society and you will get a deal on tickets.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>Amsterdam
				<p>
					While Brian and I were in Scotland, we decided to spontaneously take a
					weekend trip to Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We had never considered
					visiting Amsterdam, but we found really inexpensive tickets and decided
					to go. It ended up being one of my favorite trips.
				</p>
				<p>Highlights from Amsterdam:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Canals</li>
						<li>Ann Frank House</li>
						<li>Vlaams Friteshuis Vleminckx i.e. Dutch French Fries</li>
						<li>Tulips</li>
						<li>Museums</li>
					</ul>
				<p class= "italic">
					Tip: Use <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnb</a> to book a place to stay!
			</li>

			<li>Dublin
				<p>
					Brian and I were lucky enough to take a trip to Dublin, Ireland with
					my family last summer. My mom's ancestors are Irish so it has always
					been a dream of her's to visit there. We were there for several days
					and had a great time.
				</p>
				<p>Highlights from Dublin:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Temple Bar District</li>
						<li>Kilmainham Jaol</li>
						<li>Day Trip to Wicklow Mountains</li>
						<li>Musical Pub Crawl</li>
						<li>Fish n' Chips</li>
					</ul>
				<p class= "italic">
					Tip: Buy a day pass for a hop-on-hop-off tour bus. Cheap way to get
					around to all the major sights!
			</li>

			<li>Paris
				<p>
					I met up with a girlfriend of mine for a short trip to Paris. Paris
					had never been at the top of my list for some reason, but I am so
					glad I went! So many beautiful things to see and do.
				</p>
				<p>Highlights from Paris:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Lourve</li>
						<li>Notre Dame</li>

					</ul>
				<p class= "italic">
					Tip: Travel with a friend who is fluent in French! It made everything so much easier.
			</li>

			<li>London
				<p>
					I got to visit London twice while we lived in Scotland. Brian and I
					took an overnight bus to get there and then tried to see and do as
					many things as we could do in two days. The second time, I went with
					my parents just for one night on our way to Bath, UK.
				</p>
				<p>Highlights from London:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Westminster Abbey</li>
						<li>Tower of London</li>

					Just put in your earphones and he tells you where to go and all about
					what you are seeing!
			</li>

			<li>Cinque Terre
				<p>
					Near the end of our stay in Scotland, Brian had a conference in Genoa, Italy.
					So I tagged along and we got to hike along the Cinque Terre the day before
					the conference started. It is a portion of the Italian Riviera composed of
					five villiages that sit on the coast and overlook the sea. Paths, trains
					and boats connect the villages, and cars cannot reach them from the outside.
				</p>
				<p>Highlights from Cinque Terre:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The beautiful views</li>
						<li>The beaches</li>
						<li> Lunch in Vernazza</li>
						<li>Gnocci and pesto are local specialites</li>
						<li>Trains also connect the cities if you get tired</li>
					</ul>
				<p class= "italic">
					Tip: Wear good tennis shoes and we ready for a hike! It was very tiring
					and at times a little dangerous due to a very narrow path and steep cliffs,
					but totally worth it!
			</li>

			<li>San Francisco, California
				<p>
					A few years ago, just after Brian and I got married he had a conference
					in San Francisco, California so I got to tag along and sightsee.
